<h2> Voice over Watson Assistant </h2>

In this Document, we will provide instruction and code required to implement voice over webchat using the Watson Assistant. This means interacting with a chatbot with your voice instead of typing. We will demonstrate connecting the Watson Assistant with Wikipedia for question answer responses using voice to communicate questions and responses.


A voice chatbot is a virtual assistant that hears, perceives, and responds to your voice input. Voice chatbot assistants that read your voice input, analyse the task at hand, and respond with relevant answers. These conversational interfaces understand natural language as they use NLP and NLU, and are also trained to respond in natural language.

The Watson Assistant provides a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language.  

The user can prepare the questions as, per the business requirements, using different intents. We then configure Watson Assistant with Voice functionality.  For that, we leverage three IBM services as follows. 

1.	Watson Assistant (WA)
2.	Speech to text convertor (STT)
3.	Text to Speech convertor (TTS)

After configuring and starting the required services, we can integrate the voice solution with Watson Assistant. For this solution, we have a repository that contains HTML code for a voice UI microphone button along with Watson Assistant chatbot and JavaScript for sending the request to STT and TTS services.
