**Voice over Watson Assistant**

A popular feature to implement is voice-over-watson-assistant.  It allows the user of a Watson Assistant chatbot 
to use their voice instead of typing questions/requests.  The feature provides the response text (as normal) with the 
addition of a verbal responce to the user.
