<h2>Example Use-case:</h2>

This example use case covers Watson Assistant's dialog skills along with external API integration for _Project Management_.

Watson Assistant could be used to answer frequently asked question or most commonly asked questions or could also be used to provide explanation of domain specific terms.

In addition to the basic chat functionality, Watson Assistant could also be used to collect information from the user and fetch user profile specific detail/information from the external app/API. 

In this example use case we are taking an example of a Watson Assistant to Project Management backend integration.
